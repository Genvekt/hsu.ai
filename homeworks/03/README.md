# Bayesian reasoning (advanced) #
![Bayesian net](./bayes.png)
Given a Bayesian graph like in example implement forward reasoning.
Graph nodes are events and edges are defined with conditional probabilities.
If given initial probability of start node(s) (i.e. `P(rain) = 0.2`) compute *full probabilities* of all other nodes (events).

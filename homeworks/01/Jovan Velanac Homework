In this report they created a program that could effectively read the actions (minds in a way) of other computers, 
and effectively predict their future behaviour.
They tested this by giving computers tasks to move around a virtual room collecting boxes. 
One had no vision of the room, one couldn’t remember its steps and one could do everything. 
The computer that was set to read their behaviour could effectively read the actions of the 3 testees, 
and successfully predict their actions!

ToMnets idea behind this was that 1 day they want to read the minds of humans and animals 1 day.
ToMnet infers beliefs more efficiently than his team’s system,
which is based on a more abstract form of probabilistic reasoning rather than neural networks.
But ToMnet’s understanding is more tightly bound to the contexts in which it’s trained, he adds,
making it less able to predict behavior in radically new environments, as his system or even young children can do. 
ToMnet wants to improve computers’ cooperation with humans, and they want them to mimic human behaviour. 
They want them to even collaborate on playing games with humans, and to be more proficient than any human!

The solution Architecture of such a program is three neural networks, each made of small computing elements and 
connections that learn from experience, loosely resembling the human brain. The first network learns 
the tendencies of other AIs based on their past actions. The second forms an understanding of their current “beliefs.” 
And the third takes the output from the other two networks and, depending on the situation, predicts the AI’s next moves.
